## Luggage Storage at Melbourne's Airports

Along with laying claim to the oldest continuously operating military airfield globally, RAAF Point Cook Airport, six other airports serve travelers in and out of Melbourne. For the sake of brevity, let's go over the two you're most likely to fly in or out through, Melbourne Airport and Avalon airport.

### Melbourne Airport

Locally known as Tullamarine Airport, Melbourne Airport is the main international airport in the city. The airport is located 23 kilometres (14 miles) northwest of Melbourne city centre, just outside the Tullamarine Suburb.

Safely flying more than 20 million domestic and 10 million international travellers a year, the Melbourne Airport is so large that it has its own postcode and suburb of 104 permanent residents. In addition to operating four terminals, the airport serves as the Melbourne Airspace Control Centre, the air traffic control facility responsible for keeping aircraft safe in Australia's most congested flight information region.

Avalon Airport is the second busiest airport serving passengers in the capital, just outside Melbourne city limits. Tiny yet might; the Avalon Airport only has one helipad and a single runway. Despite its small size, Avalon Airport is the second busiest airport in Melbourne after Melbourne Airport.

Avalon Airport is, perhaps, most recognizable as the host of the biennial Australian International Airshow. Catering to international and domestic flights, the airport links up to Geelong and Melbourne via Princes Freeway, allowing passengers to easily flag down a taxi or catch the Skybus from the airport.

## Luggage Storage at Train Stations in Melbourne

With over 210 stations currently in operation, it's no exaggeration to call Melbourne a mecha of mass transport. If you're riding the rails in Australia's Garden City, then chances are, you'll be stopping at least one of its two busiest train stations: Flinders Street and Southern Cross.

### Flinders Street Railway Station

Flinders Street Railway Station is one of Melbourne's most celebrated historical landmarks. An architectural wonder first opened in 1854, the station takes up more than two whole city blocks and serves the entire metro rail network. You can see Flinders Street Station at all hours of the day, as its incredible design is fully illuminated after dark every evening. And, with the station averaging more than 77,00 travellers each day, it's also the busiest train station in all of Melbourne.

Located in the middle of the central business district, Flinders Street Railway Station is an intrinsic piece of Melbourne's history and culture. Many residents use it as a popular informal meeting space. So, if any Melburnians say they'll meet you "under the clocks" or "on the steps," chances are, they'll be waiting at Flinders Street Station.
