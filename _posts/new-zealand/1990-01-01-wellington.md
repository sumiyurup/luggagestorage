The capital city of New Zealand, Wellington, is located in the southwestern region of the nation's North Island and is the most southern capital of a sovereign state. Known as Te Whanganui-a-Tara by the native Mri people, Wellington is situated between the Remutaka Range of mountains and Cook Strait, the ocean strip separating New Zealand's Islands.

According to Mri legend, Kupe first founded and explored the Wellington region sometime during the 10th century. Until 1839, when early European settlers began entering the area, it was inhabited solely by the Mri, primarily descended from Whatonga, a Mri explorer who lived in the area around the mid-1100s.

Today, Wellington is renowned for its vivid culture, incredible cuisines, and its unparalleled natural magnificence. As a matter of fact, if you've seen the movie Avatar or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, then you already know just how incredibly beautiful Wellington is, as it served as the setting for both!

Are you thinking about visiting Wellington? If so, then continue reading below to find out where you can store your luggage for the day and get to enjoy the city of Wellington with peace of mind.

## Luggage Storage at Airports in Wellington

Although Wellington may be New Zealand's capital city, its residents and visitors are currently only served by one airport, Wellington International.

### Wellington International Airport

Formerly the Rongotai Airport, Wellington International Airport is located 5.5 kilometres (approximately three nautical miles) from the city centre, right on the coast of Cook Strait and Wellington Harbour. The Wellington International Airport is the third busiest in the nation, seeing more than 6 million passengers annually, and the second busiest for IFR movements.

The Wellington International Airport operates a single runway and, unfortunately, has a reputation among passengers to rather turbulent and sometimes even rough landings due to the winds that come in off the Cook Strait. First opened in 1949, the airport serves ten airlines flying to more than 20 destinations domestically and abroad.

Wellington's rail network is made up of more than 45 train stations, all of which are owned and operated by the Greater Wellington Regional Council. Most stations in Wellington are served by a single line, making the transit system one of the easiest to navigate for tourists.

### Wellington Railway Station

The main station in the area and the busiest, Wellington Railway Station, is the southern terminal for the Johnsonville Line, the North Island Main Trunk, and the Wairarapa Line. Now containing nine platforms, the station first opened in June of 1937 to replace the services provided by the former Lambton and Thorndon Stations.

Conveniently located smack dab in the middle of Wellington's central business district, the Wellington Railway Station is on Bunny Street in Pipitea. The station is a proud symbol of Kiwi history, having served as a venue for casualties after the infamous Wahine disaster and as part of the country's home-front defence during World War II.
