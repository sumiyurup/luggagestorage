Located on New Zealand's South Island, Queenstown is a resort town with a modest population of 16,000 people. First found and inhabited by the Mri, European settlement didn't occur in the area until the early 1860s when two non-Mri found gold in the Arrow River, encouraging the arrival of more Europeans.

Named Tuna, or 'shallow bay,' by the Mri people, Queenstown is flanked by the shores of Lake Wakatipu and the crests of nearby mountains like Cecil Peak, Walter Peak, and The Remarkables. Its close proximity to such vast landscapes, like the mountains and the lake, make Queenstown an often sought after tourism destination.

Queenstown lays claim to more than 220 adventure activities for tourists to enjoy. Hit the mountain for a day of biking, climbing, skiing, or head down to the lake to spend a day of boating, jet skiing, or swimming in the water. But, before you go, continue reading below to find out where you can safely store your stuff for a day of fun and excitement.
